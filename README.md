# Machine-Learning

In this project, I took a dataset about diamonds and used machine learning to predict pricing.  I used the clarity, cut, color, and carat of the diamond as the variables.

#### __Steps are shown in the Powerpoint__ </br>
* Step 1: Converting Data to Proper Format
* Step 2: Data Wrangling
* Step 3: Cross Validation using K-Fold
* Step 4: Linear Regression and Predictions
* Step 5: Accuracy Score and Examining Error

## __Summary:__ </br>
* Found the model to be about 87% accurate.  More data will be needed to get a better fitting model.
